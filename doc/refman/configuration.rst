Configuration
*************

A hardware instance is configured using a single configuration
structure. It is passed as a SystemVerilog packed struct through the
system hierarchy. In the following you find the configuration items
with a description and how they become visible in software if
applicable.

There are two types of configuration items: base configuration items
are set by the designer and derived configuration items are derived by
the OpTiMSoC structure.

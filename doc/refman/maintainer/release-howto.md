OpTiMSoC Release HOWTO
======================

What needs to be done to release a new OpTiMSoC version?


OpTiMSoC releases are named YEAR.N, where YEAR is the current year
(four-digit), and N is a incrementing number starting at 1 representing
the Nth release in YEAR.

1. Tag the source code in git on the `master` branch

   We use annotated tags for releases to record the release author and the
   release date properly. All release version tags start with "v".

   ```
   git tag -am "Release vYEAR.N" vYEAR.N
   ```

2. Build the code for this release
   ```
   cd $OPTIMSOC_SRC
   make dist
   ```
   The resulting binary packages are named
   `objdir/optimsoc-YEAR.N-[base|examples].tar.gz`

3. Test the release and make sure it works.

4. Push the tag to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin vYEAR.N
   ```

5. Follow the
   [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
   on how to create a release.

   In this process you can also upload the created binary packages.
